# CESM MODEL



<img src="../fig/cesm01.jpg">

The [Community Earth System Model](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/) (CESM) is a fully-coupled, global climate model that provides state-of-the-art computer simulations of the Earth's past, present, and future climate states.

## CAM 6 Source code overview

The full description of the Community Atmosphere Model CAM 6 can be found [here](https://ncar.github.io/CAM/doc/build/html/index.html).  

## CESM 

CESM is a fully-coupled, community, global climate model that provides state-of-the-art computer simulations of the Earth's past, present, and future climate states.  
Some facts about CESM:

*   Written in Fortran 90
*   About 900 000 lines of Fortran 90 code
*   About 12,000 lines of scripts that configure, build, and run the model
*   Parallelized with [MPI](http://www.mpi-forum.org/) (Message Passing Interface) and [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) (Open Multi-Processing)
*   To keep track of code changes, CESM developers currently use [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). 
*   Fortran Coding standard as well as style rules are enforced and anyone wishing to contribute to the Community Atmosphere Model must comply to these [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CAM/wiki).

To browse and explore CAM6 source code, you can look at [CAM github repository dev branch](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CAM/tree/cam_development).  

From a Linux terminal:

~~~ 
ssh -Y $LOGNAME@saga.sigma2.no
~~~ 
{: .language-bash}

where $LOGNAME is your UIO username (replace it by your own username!)  
Documentation on NIRD facility can be found [here](https://documentation.sigma2.no/storage/nird.html).  

The source code we will be using is stored (on Saga) in `/cluster/projects/nn1000k/cesm` and the cam component in `/cluster/projects/nn1000k/cesm/components/cam`:

~~~ 
module use /cluster/projects/nn1000k/modulefiles
module load cesm
cd $CESM_HOME/components/cam
ls 
~~~
{: .language-bash}



*   **bld**: scripts to generate makefiles and dependencies for compiling CAM6
*   **chem_proc**: MOZART [chemical preprocessor](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working_groups/Chemistry/chemistry.preprocessor.pdf)
*   **doc**: change log
*   **src**: source code for CAM6
*   **test**: CAM testing framework
*   **tools**: utility to generate or remap terrain dataset
*   **cime_config**: configuration for running CAM within CESM e.g. number of processors, etc.

The source code for CAM 6 is located in the "src" and its sub-directories (the main parts are highlighted in bold):

*   **control**: contains several Fortran 90 modules to control CAM 6\. That's a good starting point to explore CAM source code. Look for instance at cam_comp.F90:  
    The main subroutines for controlling CAM 6 are:
