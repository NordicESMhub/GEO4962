<img src="fig/geo4962.png" alt="GEO4962 course">

The course gives a broad overview about the general circulation of the atmosphere, including the tropospheric and stratospheric circulations. The lecture will cover the transport of climate and ozone relevant gases, which are important for the chemical composition and for the radiative budget of the atmosphere. Future climate and ozone changes affecting the general circulation of the atmosphere will be highlighted.

**Learning outcome**

After finishing this course, students should understand:

- Tropospheric Circulation,
- Brewer Dobson Circulation,
- Stratospheric Ozone distribution,
- Dynamics and chemistry of key trace gases,
- Climate change and the Ozone Hole.
